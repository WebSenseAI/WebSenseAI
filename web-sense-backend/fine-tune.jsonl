He acknowledges the common question faced by university students—'What do you want to do?'—and the unique challenge it poses to philosophy students due to prevailing stereotypes about the field leading to a lack of career prospects. However, he defends his choice by emphasizing the value of studying philosophy for its own sake, driven by passion and a desire for knowledge rather than a specific career path. He highlights the diverse career opportunities available to philosophy graduates, ranging from publishing to roles in public administration and private companies, demonstrating the versatility of philosophical skills in various fields. Drawing on insights from philosophers like Schopenhauer and Edgar Morin, he argues that philosophy cultivates critical thinking, logical reasoning, and self-awareness, which are valuable assets in navigating life's complexities and finding meaning. He challenges the notion that philosophy is irrelevant or impractical, suggesting instead that society would benefit from more philosophical inquiry to broaden perspectives and encourage deeper reflection. Ultimately, he concludes that the enduring skepticism toward philosophy underscores a need for greater philosophical engagement to liberate closed minds and foster a more profound understanding of the human experience."}]}

It expresses concern for peers who seem to lack direction, settling for mundane routines without aspirations for personal or professional growth. The author questions the fulfillment derived from such a life, contrasting it with the idea of pursuing passions and engaging in meaningful endeavors. Drawing on Yukio Mishima's analogy from 'Sun and Steel' the author likens life to a house with a garden, where the house symbolizes one's inherent qualities, while the garden represents the choices and actions that shape life. Mishima's concept suggests the need for active engagement in shaping one's destiny, akin to cultivating a garden with the aid of sunlight and tools like steel plows. Conversely, passivity and resignation to fate are likened to neglecting the garden, resulting in missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. The passage advocates for a proactive approach to life, where individuals actively seek out their passions and aspirations, akin to tending a garden to yield vibrant flowers amidst the wilderness. It urges against complacency and settling for mediocrity, emphasizing the importance of personal growth, fulfillment, and the pursuit of meaningful dreams."}]}
